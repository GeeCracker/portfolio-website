I really like making stuff, especially apps and websites. Through my experiences working on various projects, I’ve discovered a passion for developing attractive and responsive front-end UIs. I am also a very organized developer; I love when codebases are tidy and well-documented.</p>\r\n            <p>My journey into tech started in high school. My first exposure to any sort of development was learning about HTML and CSS in a business technologies class grade 10. Throughout high school, I learned more about web development and I honed my skills. I also started taking an interest in computer science, which led me to Queen’s Computing. During this time, I worked on several start-up projects with friends which introduced me to the world of entrepreneurship. This early exposure has led me down a path of working on lots of start-up projects with small teams. I really love the feeling when you are able to create something out of practically nothing, and modern development tools are an amazing way to make that happen.</p>\r\n            <p>My favorite technologies to work with right now are JavaScript-based frameworks like React and React Native. A lot of my recent work has focused on web and mobile front-end development, but I’m interested in getting my hand on all sorts of things. My number one goal right now is to learn as much as I can about all sorts of technologies so that I can apply my knowledge in the future.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"about-body\">\r\n            Get in{\" \"}\r\n            <a \r\n                style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} \r\n                href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gcarkner/\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n            >\r\n                <span>touch</span>\r\n            </a>\r\n            {\" \"}or check out my{\" \"}\r\n            <a \r\n                style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} \r\n                href=\"https://github.com/GeeCracker\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n            >\r\n                <span>github</span>\r\n            </a>.\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <motion.img \r\n            class=\"face\" \r\n            src={face} \r\n            initial=\"hidden\"\r\n            animate=\"visible\"\r\n            variants={{\r\n                hidden: {\r\n                    marginLeft: -400\r\n                },\r\n                visible: {\r\n                    marginLeft: 0\r\n                }\r\n            }}\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","D:\\My Stuff\\portfolio-website\\src\\components\\LandingNav.js",[],"D:\\My Stuff\\portfolio-website\\src\\components\\WorkImage.js",[],{"ruleId":"37","replacedBy":"38"},{"ruleId":"39","replacedBy":"40"},{"ruleId":"41","severity":1,"message":"42","line":6,"column":42,"nodeType":"43","messageId":"44","endLine":6,"endColumn":53},{"ruleId":"45","severity":1,"message":"46","line":171,"column":13,"nodeType":"47","endLine":174,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"45","severity":1,"message":"46","line":178,"column":13,"nodeType":"47","endLine":181,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"48","severity":1,"message":"49","line":186,"column":9,"nodeType":"47","endLine":186,"endColumn":55},{"ruleId":"45","severity":1,"message":"46","line":24,"column":13,"nodeType":"47","endLine":28,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"45","severity":1,"message":"46","line":32,"column":13,"nodeType":"47","endLine":36,"endColumn":14},"no-native-reassign",["50"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["51"],"no-unused-vars","'useLocation' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","react/jsx-no-target-blank","Using target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener","JSXOpeningElement","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
